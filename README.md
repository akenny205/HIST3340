# The Materiality of the PDF

A web-based exploration of how digital documents (specifically PDFs) compare to printed texts in terms of materiality, ownership, and the reading experience. Created for **HIST 3340: Technologies of Text** at Northeastern University, Fall 2025.

## About the Project

This interactive website investigates what it means for a digital document to be treated as a piece of text. It examines how PDFs are similar to and different from traditional printed materials—exploring topics like software dependency, instant duplicability, metadata, compression, and digital ownership.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd HIST3340
   ```

2. Navigate to the website folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd website
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

### Building for Production

                <p>When you hold a book, you feel it. The weight in your hands, the texture under your fingertips, the sound of pages turning,these sensory experiences are part of reading. Paper quality signals value, purpose, and permanence in ways we often take for granted.</p>

                <h3>The Labor of Paper</h3>
                <p>Before industrialization, papermaking was skilled craft labor. As Heidi Craig documents in "English Rag Women and Early Modern Paper Production," women played a central but often invisible role, collecting rags, sorting fibers, and preparing the raw materials that would become the pages of books. Each sheet represented hours of human work, much of it performed by laborers whose contributions went unrecorded.</p>
                <p>In China, where paper was invented, the tradition of Cai Lun papermaking dates back nearly two thousand years. The craft required intimate knowledge of plant fibers, water, and technique passed down through generations. This labor shaped who had access to the written word, texts were precious because their materials were precious.</p>

                <h3>Paper as Vibrant Matter</h3>
                <p>Jane Bennett's concept of "vibrant matter" invites us to consider paper not as passive material but as an active participant in meaning-making. Paper yellows, absorbs moisture, holds scent, responds to touch. It has what Bennett calls "thing-power", an agency that shapes how we interact with texts. The PDF, by contrast, has no such material presence to push back against the reader.</p>

                <h3>Digital "Paper"</h3>
                <p>Software sometimes mimics paper textures, page-turn animations, "parchment" backgrounds. But these are images of paper, not paper itself. The screen remains glass regardless of what it displays. The bodily experience of reading shifts from tactile to visual, from weight to weightlessness.</p>

              <h4>Course Connections</h4>
              <p>In "The Adventures of a Quire of Paper," an 18th-century it-narrative, paper itself becomes the narrator, traveling from rag heap to printing press, experiencing the world through its material transformations. This literary device reminds us that paper has a life before and beyond the words printed on it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md); margin-bottom: 0;">Amaranth Borsuk's <em>The Book as Object</em> argues that the book is not just a container for text but a technology with its own history of materials and making. Lisa Gitelman's "Near Print and Beyond Paper" extends this thinking to the PDF, asking what happens when documents move "beyond paper" while still mimicking its form. The question is not whether digital texts have materiality, but what <em>kind</em> of materiality they possess.</p>

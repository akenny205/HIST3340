                <h3>From Scroll to Codex</h3>
                <p>The shift from scroll to codex (bound pages) was one of the most significant technological transitions in textual history. The codex allowed random access, you could flip to any page without unrolling the entire text. This simple innovation changed how people read, referenced, and organized knowledge.</p>

                <h3>Bound and Unbound</h3>
                <p>As James N. Green explores in "Bound/Unbound," the state of a book's binding tells us about its intended life. Books sold unbound were meant to be custom-bound by their owners, a mark of personalization and wealth. Mass-market bindings democratized access but standardized the object. The binding's condition reveals how a book was used, stored, and valued.</p>

                <h3>The Bibliophile's Obsession</h3>
                <p>Charles W. Chesnutt's satirical story "Baxter's Procrustes" skewers bibliophiles who obsess over fine bindings, limited editions, and uncut pages. The club members value a book for its material form so completely that they never read it, and when the pages turn out to be blank, the "book" becomes more valuable still. Chesnutt reminds us that fetishizing the book-as-object can obscure the text itself.</p>

                <h3>Binding as Social Marker</h3>
                <p>A leather-bound volume with gilt edges signals permanence, importance, and wealth. A mass-market paperback with glued spine signals accessibility and disposability. The same text, differently bound, carries different meanings. We judge books by their covers, and their spines, their boards, their endpapers.</p>

                <h3>Digital "Binding"</h3>
                <p>A PDF has no spine to crack, no pages to turn, no cover to judge. The pages are not bound but sequenced, data points in an array, not physical sheets sewn together. The experience of opening a book, feeling its weight distribute as the covers fall open, is replaced by a scroll bar and a page number.</p>

              <h4>Course Connections</h4>
              <p>In class, we bound pages from the book we composed ourselves, experiencing firsthand how signatures are gathered, sewn, and attached to boards. The labor of binding makes visible what mass production hides: that every book is an assembly, a construction, a made thing.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md); margin-bottom: 0;">Chesnutt's satire warns against loving books as objects while ignoring their contents. Yet there is real meaning in material form. A PDF of "Baxter's Procrustes" cannot replicate the irony of its original publication, the fine binding that contained nothing. The joke requires the physical book.</p>
